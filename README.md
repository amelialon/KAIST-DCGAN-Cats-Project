# DCGANs for Cat Image Generation

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for generating realistic cat images. This project was conducted as part of an individual research project at KAIST.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to explore generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their application to image synthesis. Using the DCGAN architecture, the model was trained on a dataset of cat images to generate new, realistic cat images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is the [Hugging Face HugGAN Cats Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggan/cats). It contains a variety of cat images preprocessed to 64x64 resolution.

## Model Architecture
The DCGAN model follows the standard architecture outlined by Radford et al. (2015):
- Generator: A series of transposed convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activations to generate 64x64 RGB images.
- Discriminator: A series of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and LeakyReLU activations to classify images as real or fake.

## Installation
To set up the environment and install required packages, run the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv dcgan_env
source dcgan_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\dcgan_env\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training the Model
To train the DCGAN model, execute the following command:

```bash
python train_dcgan.py --dataroot <path_to_dataset> --batch_size 64 --epochs 100
```

Adjust hyperparameters such as `batch_size` and `epochs` according to your system's capacity.

## Generating Images
After training, you can generate cat images using the trained generator:

```bash
python generate_images.py --num_images 10
```

Generated images will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Results
Here are some sample images generated by the DCGAN model:
